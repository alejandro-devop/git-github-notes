# Chapter 4, First steps

Is time to start writing commands in git, our first step and most important is to identify ourselves, tell git what is our user name, whether we are working alone or we are working with others this is a very important step.

**Open your bash** and type the following command:

```bash
git config --global user.email "[my-user-name]"
```
> **Note** Replace `[my-user-name]` with your username (including the squared brackes)

Example: `git config --global user.email "alejandro.devop@gmail.com"`

Your must be wondering why we enter and email, well, emails usually are unique, so they suit pretty well as unique usernames.

Now, not required, but helps, is telling git a human name, just to let know to any other person working with us, what is our name.

**Open your bash** and type the following command
```bash
git config --global user.name "[your full name]"
```
> Replace the `[your full name]` with your full name

Example: `git config --global user.name "Alejandro quiroz"`


> **Note** You can find these commands in the [Cheat-sheet.md](https://github.com/alejandro-devop/git-github-notes/blob/main/Cheat-sheet.md) file
