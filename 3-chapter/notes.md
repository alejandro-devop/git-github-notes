# Chapter 3, Installation

## Installation of git in windows
On windows the installation is easy, you can download the installer directly from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads), 

The most important is that when you see the following screen you make sure you mark the `Git bash Here` and `Git GUI here` boxes (Believe me, it will help you in the future)

Once installation is done you will be able to see the following menu when you press the right button of your mouse on any folder.

That black window you will be seing is the Bash, a special bash that will allow you to execute all the commands we will be describing in this notes.

> Note: when you read open **your bash** this is what I mean.
