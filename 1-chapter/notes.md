# What is git?

Before jumping into github is important to know first that **Git** and **Git hub** are two different things, but one could not exists without the other (**Git hub** could not exist without **Git**). Now we can start talking on what git is: 

> _"Is a tool to allow developers work together on the same project from different computeers or even different locations"_

If you search you will find a lot of definitions about what git is (You will read things as [Control Version System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control)), but I want you to keep in my the definition I gave you, just for now, we will cover more about what git is and what we can do with it later.

## The problem git solves, and a little bit of history

As mentioned above git is used to allow developers work on the same project (A project could be a bunch of files, a word document, a Photoshop file, etc.). 

Before the invention of any tool that allows this collaborative work, it was a real pain to work with others. People used to share their code or changes to the project using [disks](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disquete) or external storage devices in order to translate their work to their team mate's computer. Easy if you work on the same physical space, but if they were in different locations, then the person must go to a post office (Internet was not as fast as today). Once the person manage to take the changes to it's destination, this changes must to be added manually... 

To solve all of this problems a bunch of people created a software solution, the [Control Version Systems](https://medium.com/@mehran.hrajabi98/a-brief-history-of-version-control-systems-vcss-5881f07ba0e1), these tools solved the problem and they were very popular in the software industry. But sadly, most of these invented tools were _**pay to use**_ and not everyone could affort the prices, at that time a lot of [Open Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) communities where born and a lot of them needed a tool to work together, including the [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) Community. 

If you work with something related to software, or you study made a little research, you probably know what linux is... Linux is a huge project, and it was not created by a single person, it was created by a lot o people who worked together to make it what it is today. At the very first time they use a **Control Version System** named **BitKeeper**, but when the relation with the company **BitKeeper** broke up, then the linux community decided to create It's own **Control Version System**, **GIT**...
